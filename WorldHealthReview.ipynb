    "To do this you will be using some built in functions of Pandas. In fact, it takes your dataframe and converts it to an SQL table. We will be using \"SQLite\" database - which is just one of many types of databases using the SQL language. Also we will be using another python library called \"sqlalchemy\"[https://www.sqlalchemy.org/] Here is a very very similar tutorial showing you how to do these steps with NYC 311 calls (open dataset also available from Toronto!!):[https://plot.ly/python/big-data-analytics-with-pandas-and-sqlite/] * Note it is also using a library \"plotly\" - another visualization library - this one is a paid service as well. But we will use Plotly's free version tomorrow's lab. \n",
