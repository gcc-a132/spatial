    "his 50-odd internal customers that, unless some \"magic\" can be worked, the\n",
    "rates his division charges are going to be about 20 percent higher next year.\n",

    "occupied for the last five years to brand-new, very fancy and very expensive\n",
    "facilities. Long-term, all things considered, this is a good move for Frank's\n",
    "company. But, short-term, the cost of space has more than doubled. On the\n",
    "other side of the equation, things are equally glum. Frank's division has\n",
    "been losing work. The work lost amounts to 20 percent of the division's\n",
    "hours for the previous year. Frank saw some of this coming and earlier in\n",
    "the year took steps to reduce his division's staff. In addition, he instructed \n",
    "his managers to begin making greater use of less expensive temporary\n",
    "agency staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net of all this is that the fixed expenses in Frank's division have\n",
    "increased considerably and must now be distributed over a much smaller\n",

    "order to recover the expense of work performed in his division have been\n",
